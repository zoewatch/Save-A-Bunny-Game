      Did you know: bunnies have one of the highest rates of euthanization? <br>
      This website aims to bring to light the fact that many bunnies are adopted for easter or are simply a used as toy and end up in the shelter. <br>
      The bunnies on this website are a rememberance for all the bunnies that never got "clicked on" and spent their last moments in a shelter.<br>
      If you can adopt or foster a bunny and are serious about long term bunny commitment or are able to donate please click <a href="https://rabbitadvocates.org/">on this link</a> to help bunnies in need.
